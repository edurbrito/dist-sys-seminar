  abstract = {How to reach an agreement in a blockchain network is a complex and important task that is defined as a consensus problem and has wide applications in reality including distributed computing, load balancing, and transaction validation in blockchains. Over recent years, many studies have been done to cope with this problem. In this paper, a comparative and analytical review on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus algorithms is presented to enlighten the strengths and constraints of each algorithm. Based on their inherent specifications, each algorithm has a different domain of applicability that yields to propose several performance criteria for the evaluation of these algorithms. To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithmsâ€™ throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.}

  abstract = {The success of blockchain as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies has opened up possibilities for its use in other application domains as well. The main advantages of blockchain for its potential use in other areas are its inherent security mechanisms and immunity to data manipulation attacks. A blockchain relies on a consensus method for agreeing on any new data. Most of the consensus methods which are currently used for the blockchain of different cryptocurrencies require high computational power and thus are not suitable for resource-constrained systems. In this article, we survey the various blockchain-based consensus methods that are applicable to resource-constrained IoT devices and networks. In a typical IoT network, there exist several devices with limited computational and communication capabilities. Most often, these devices cannot perform intensive computations and are starved for bandwidth. Therefore, we discuss the possible measures that can be taken to reduce the computational power and convergence time for the underlying consensus methods. We also talk about some of the alternatives to the public blockchain, such as private blockchain and tangle, along with their potential adoption for IoT networks. Furthermore, we review the existing consensus methods that have been implemented and explore the possibility of utilizing them to realize a blockchain-based IoT network. Some of the open research challenges including AI-enabled blockchains are also put forward.}

  abstract = {Blockchain, the underlying technology of Bitcoin, refers to the public ledger used in a distributed network. Because blockchain does not rely on a central authority, peers have to agree on the state of the ledger among themselves, i.e., they have to reach a consensus on the state of the transactions. The way nodes reach that consensus has gained incredible attention in the literature. Bitcoin uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, as did Ethereum at first. The latter decided to move from PoW to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) because of the high energy consumption required by PoW. To date, many other consensus protocols have been proposed to address the limitations of the seminal ones. In this paper, we inform researchers and practitioners about the current state of consensus protocols research. The aim is to provide an analysis of the research introducing new consensus protocols in order to enable a more unified treatment. To that end, we review 28 new consensus protocols and we propose a four-category classification framework: Origin, Design, Performance and Security. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework by classifying the 28 protocols. Many surveys have already been proposed in the literature and some of them will be discussed later in the paper. Yet, we believe that this work is relevant and important for two reasons. Firstly, blockchain being a fast evolving topic, new consensus protocols emerge regularly and improvements are also put forward on a regular basis. Hence, this work aims at reflecting the latest state-of-the-art in terms of consensus protocols. Secondly, we aim to propose a comprehensive classification framework, integrating knowledge from multiple works in the literature, as well as introducing classification dimensions that have not been proposed before. This work demonstrates that multiple consensus have been proposed in a short period of time, and highlights the differences between these protocols. Furthermore, it is suggested that researchers and practitioners who aim to propose consensus protocols in the future should pay attention to all the dimensions presented in the classification framework.}
