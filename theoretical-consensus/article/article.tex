% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -

% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that

% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{L}{ong} has been the time when consensus started 
to be defined as a fundamental problem of distributed systems \cite{pease1980reaching, lamport2019byzantine, lamport1983weak}. 
Generally, consensus means reaching an agreement between multiple parties 
in the potential presence of faulty individuals. As per multi-agent systems, 
interacting over computer networks, consensus is thought to be the result 
of a coordination effort such that those parties agree on some value at a 
given moment. Achieving consensus implies that the system shall be reliable 
and fault-tolerant. However, the consensus problem has been limited by some 
assumptions on the networks. The well-known "secure Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant 
multiparty consensus systems" that have been designed over the years are usually 
meant to work only with a set of known participants, faulty or not \cite{castro1999practical}. The 
other side of the coin is the permissionless consensus challenge, consisting of 
achieving agreement in an environment where the participants are unknown and 
untrusted \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin, buterin2014next}. Plus, there are other intrinsic particularities of 
this type of networks, for example, their openness, and the lack of any kind of central 
authority. This adds another layer of complexity to the problem, as the participants 
are not only unknown and untrusted but can also join or leave the network at any time, 
freely choosing if they want to participate in the consensus protocol or not. Nevertheless, 
the problem of permissionless consensus can still be seen as a special case of the more 
general consensus and can still be formalized in the same way. In this paper, we will 
focus on consensus in permissionless systems, especially in the context of blockchain 
networks. We will reason about its meaningfulness, ultimately by trying to identify the units that 
may underpin consensus. We will also discuss the current state-of-the-art, with a 
particular interest in the shift of the consensus layer of these distributed networks 
to mobile and edge computing environments, for which computationally expensive consensus 
algorithms are impractical and unfair.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Classical Consensus}

The establishment of a definition for the problem of reaching agreement in a distributed 
system was pioneered by Lamport et al. in \cite{pease1980reaching}. 
The authors defined consensus as the problem of agreeing on a single value among a set of processes, 
in the presence of faulty entities. The first consensus algorithms were designed for 
synchronous systems, where the communication between the processes is reliable, and the 
delay is bounded. However, these initial attempts failed to cover the different types of 
faulty behaviour. Along with the establishment of the famous Byzantine Generals Problem, 
the first solutions, not only for dealing with treason, but also for unreliable communication 
channels, or any other kind of arbitrary byzantine behaviour, were 
also proposed by Lamport in \cite{lamport2019byzantine,lamport1983weak}. The solution was a synchronous 
mechanism that used a set of leaders to reach consensus. Multiple practical implementations 
and optimizations to this solution have been proposed in the literature. 

\subsection{Asynchronous Byzantine Consensus}

The first asynchronous consensus algorithm was later proposed by Castro and Liskov in \cite{castro1999practical}. 
And naturally, after that work, many other asynchronous consensus algorithms have appeared. 
However, all of them are based on the assumption that the number of faulty processes is less than 
a certain threshold. Additionally, the assumption of a known set of participants is also made. This is a very strong assumption, 
as it is not always possible to know the participants beforehand as they may, for example, participate anonymously, or dynamically.

\subsection{Permissionless Consensus}

The advancements of the internet 
more than potentiated the revolution and what we now call the permissionless consensus problem was 
finally born. Without forgetting the previous attempts, the first practical permissionless consensus algorithm was 
proposed by Nakamoto in \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. It is a proof-of-work consensus protocol that resembles a "replicated 
state machine" where the independent participants reach agreement not only about transactional values, 
but also about their order. "Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote" and this is the novelty 
introduced by Bitcoin \cite{pass2016hybrid,pass2016hybrid2}. The focus shifted 
for decentralized systems and after proof-of-work many other consensus mechanisms have been proposed, 
based on different consensus units, like proof-of-stake, proof-of-space, proof-of-burn, etc. The chaotic 
diversity of new consensus protocols gave also room for endless reviews, overviews and comparisons \cite{survey-dist-consensus, BAMAKAN2020113385, 8400278, 8629877, 9376868, BOURAGA2021114384}. 
The authors of these surveys often put multiple dimensions into comparison, like fault tolerance, scalability, or energy consumption,
and, among those, some focused their efforts on mechanisms that may work in resource-constrained networks \cite{9104713, 8661654, 8168250, SALIMITARI2020100212}. 
This paper will try to identify the common conclusions from these comparisons, while looking into the state-of-the-art and novel approaches for running permissionless
consensus protocols in mobile and edge devices.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}

%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

% \section{Conclusion}

% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]

% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
